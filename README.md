# CS-350
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
What did you do particularly well?
Where could you improve?
What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

For the final project in this course we were tasked with using pins as temperature sensors. Coding in buttons that the user could press to increase or decrease 
the setpoint temperature. The othere file is the first milestone where we were tasked with setting the LED lights to change brightness on a timer. For both of these
projects I felt as if I implemented timers well. I had some challenges getting the buttons to work on the final project and this is something I feel I could improve upon.
I am going to be using this github repository as a tool to go back and look through my work that I have completed in this course. I believe the skills on troubleshooting
will be very tranferable to other work I do in future courses. I had a lot of difficulty using the microcontroller at first and finally leaving this course I feel 
more comfortable in how it works and how to code programs for it. From the first few courses in computer science we were taught to comment out our code. I continue to 
practice this and I believe that is what makes the code maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
